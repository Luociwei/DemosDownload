# Notarize
#
# Uploads to Apple's notarization service, polls until it completes, staples the ticket to the built app, then creates a new zip.
#
# Requires four arguments:
#   - Apple ID username
#   - Apple ID app-specific password (store this in your Keychain and use the @keychain:$NAME syntax to prevent your password from being added to your shell history)
#   - App Store Connect provider name
#   - Path to .app to upload
#
# Assumes that there's a .app beside the .zip with the same name so it can be stapled and re-zipped.
#
# E.g. notarize.sh "test@example.com" "@keychain:altool" MyOrg Xcodes.zip
